## Initialize a Node.js project:
npm init -y

## Install TypeScript:
npm install typescript --save-dev

## Initialize TypeScript configuration:
npx tsc --init

## 2. Create Project Structure
## Create directories and main file:
mkdir src dist
touch src/index.ts

## 3. Write Game Code
Open src/index.ts and start coding the game logic. We prepared a basic structure to help you get started.

## 4. Compile and Run
## Compile TypeScript code:
npx 

## Run the compiled code:
node dist/index.js

## 5. Continue Development
Implement game logic: Complete the logic for checking the winner and handling draw situations.
Create a user interface: Develop a simple HTML/CSS interface and use JavaScript for DOM manipulation to make the game interactive.
Enhance features: Add additional features such as restart game, score tracking, and animations.
