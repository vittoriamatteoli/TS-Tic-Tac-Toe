// Open src/index.ts and start coding the game logic. Hereâ€™s a basic structure to help you get started:

type Player = 'X' | 'O';
type Cell = Player | null;

const createBoard = (): Cell[][] => [
    [null, null, null],
    [null, null, null],
    [null, null, null]
];

// Define the necessary functions and types to play a game of TicTacToe:
                 
// createBoard: Initializes a new game board:
                 
// printBoard: Prints the current state of the board:
                 
// makeMove: Makes a move on the board for the current player, if the cell is empty:
                 
// checkWinner: Checks if there is a winner
