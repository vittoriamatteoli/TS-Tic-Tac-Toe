# TicTacToe Game
This project is a TypeScript implementation of the classic TicTacToe game. The goal is to provide a functional and interactive game where two players (X and O) take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The game ends when one player has three marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) or when all spaces on the board are filled without a winner.

## Features
Board Initialization: Initializes a 3x3 grid for gameplay.
Move Validation: Checks if a move is valid before placing a mark on the board.
Win Condition: Detects and declares a winner if a player gets three marks in a row.
Turn Management: Alternates turns between Player X and Player O.

## Technologies Used
TypeScript

## Usage
To run the project locally, ensure you have TypeScript installed. Clone the repository and compile the TypeScript files. Execute the compiled JavaScript files to play the game.
