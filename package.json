  "description": "This project is a TypeScript implementation of the classic TicTacToe game. The goal is to provide a functional and interactive game where two players (X and O) take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The game ends when one player has three marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) or when all spaces on the board are filled without a winner.",
